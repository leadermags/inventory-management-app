# Inventory Management System

This project imitates an Inventory Management System using the command-line then saves the inventory list into a database (.dat) file in the user's home directory.

User will be presented with the following menu:
- View Products
- Add Product
- Update Product
- Remove Product

The product's UPC, description, price, and the amount in stock will be tracked.
